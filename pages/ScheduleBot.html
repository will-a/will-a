        This is a Discord bot a friend and I made as a solution for checking if our friends were busy
        without having to manually ask them. The bot stores users' schedules after having them use commands in
        the chat to input classes, locations, and time ranges and provides functionality to print everyone's schedule 
        as well as check who is currently free. The information is stored locally using a Python library called Pickle
        so the data would persist through bot restarts, as the bot was usually hosted by either a Raspberry Pi or on one
        of our computers.
